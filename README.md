## notes

I decided to try to build this in React as a crash-course in React. I've never used React, mostly Vue, but it seemed like there would be enough similarity to make it feasible. And there is, structuring this was logical in that sense. However, there are enough differences in the two frameworks that it definitely proved to be more difficult and slower than imagined. 

Overall, this was done in about five hours, sorry. I gave myself a little extra time and to go back through and add comments.
